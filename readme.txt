review the spam it catches under your blog's "Comments" admin screen.

Major new features in Keypic 0.2 include:

* A comment status history, so you can easily see which comments were caught or cleared by Keypic, and which were spammed or unspammed by a moderator
* Links are highlighted in the comment body, to reveal hidden or misleading links
* If your web host is unable to reach Keypic's servers, the plugin will automatically retry when your connection is back up
* Moderators can see the number of approved comments for each user
* Spam and Unspam reports now include more information, to help improve accuracy

PS: You'll need an [Keypic FormID](http://keypic.com/) to use it.  Keys are free for every kind of use (It's free and will always be.)
