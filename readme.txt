Keypic checks your comments against the Keypic Web Service to see if they look like spam or not.

== Description ==

Keypic checks your forms against the Keypic Web Service to see if they look like spam or not and lets you
review the spam it catches under your blog's "Comments" admin screen.


Major new features in Keypic 0.1 include:

* A comment status history, so you can easily see which comments were caught or cleared by Keypic, and which were spammed or unspammed by a moderator
* Links are highlighted in the comment body, to reveal hidden or misleading links
* If your web host is unable to reach Keypic's servers, the plugin will automatically retry when your connection is back up
* Moderators can see the number of approved comments for each user
* Spam and Unspam reports now include more information, to help improve accuracy

PS: You'll need an [Keypic FormID](http://keypic.com/) to use it.  Keys are free for every kind of use (It's free and will always be.)
