NO CAPTCHA Anti-Spam. Keypic checks your blogs comments against the comprehensive Keypic Web Service to see if they look like spam or not.

== Description ==

Keypic is not a CAPTCHA provider, we completely remove the concept of CAPTCHA!
Keypic checks your forms against the comprehensive Keypic Web Service to see if they look like spam or not and lets you
review the spam it catches under your blog's "Comments" admin screen.
Keypic also protects your login form from focused hacking attempts, your registration form from unwanted spammers and most other forms that you insert into your website :)
If you want a complete antispam solution and you don't want to install CAPTCHAs plugins or plugins similar to CAPTCHA, this is the right choice for you.
It is also possible to perform a live installation from http://wordpress.keypic.com/
